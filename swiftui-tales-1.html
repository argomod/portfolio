<h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">SwiftUI Tales 1</h1>       
<p class="sec-text spacing-medium-top">July 2024 — This is part one of the story of how I and the TPL (Times Product Language) team
    built an iOS version of the TPL design system, all without knowing SwiftUI and without a dedicated iOS engineer.
</p>


<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">That pesky question</h2>
<p>"Should designers code?”</p>

<p>I learned SwiftUI the same way Joe and Sergio did. We spent many hours studying, practicing, and rigorously iterating on our work to ship things worthwhile to our customers and NYT readers. The difference in our outcomes I think offers some insight into the question.</p>

<p>I’m not as good at making the source code efficient for production. That’s probably not surprising, but I’ll remind you, I’ve been coding as my “secret sauce” for 8 years. What matters is that coding hasn’t been my proper job for that whole time. Joe and Sergio are experienced as engineers—able to connect the dots between coding languages incredibly fast.
</p>

<p>But as a designer I connect different dots very well: </p>

<ol class="spacing-xsmall-bottom">
    <li>At the prototyping phase (very beginning), where I need to balance design requirements and engineering feasibility</li>
    <li>At the polish phase (very end), where I need to make documentation and code comments feel like a cohesive product.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also test with VoiceOver and Dynamic Type and add accessibility code anytime.</p>

<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>


<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Line height</h2>
<p>The journey to translate typographic line height between web, iOS, and Figma highlights my role nicely. I personally think line height is a special detail that makes visual design shine (designer alert!). I really wanted to get it right across all of the platforms.</p>
<p>Our design system uses JSON to store a single source of truth for basic decision decisions across web, iOS, and Figma. That means ideally one value can either be directly injected into our code base or easily translated to work with a platform’s preferred convention. I needed to decide what value makes most sense to store line height in our JSON.</p>
<p>In web, line height is expressed in any unit accepted in CSS; unitless numbers are most accessible. In Figma, line height is expressed in either an integer or percentage.</p>
<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>
<p>With Xcode I learned SwiftUI also takes an integer… but using the number Figma produced was way off. What’s happening here?</p>
<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>
<p>SwiftUI’s line height is similar to pixels in Figma and web, but the integer starts with the font size. Or mathematically the formula I developed (and we now use as a JSON transform) is:</p>
<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>
<p>One consequence I didn’t realize until later is that it’s impossible to provide a line height less than 100% of the font size; that isn’t common in practice, but one of our condensed fonts was affected. I had to use FontForge to adjust the metrics manually.</p>
<p>But an even bigger problem emerged: how SwiftUI distributes line height.</p>
<p>While web and Figma evenly distributes space above and below a line of text, Apple places space only in between lines of text.</p>
<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>
<p>Yes,this is why our designs in Figma always have spacing issues around text! Joe and I call this the “half-leading problem”, to which we have not attempted a programmatic fix but alert our customets to.</p>


<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Summary</h2>
<p>I and the TPL team learned how to produce color, font size, font weight, and spacing in SwiftUI and then used our combined platform knowledge to distribute 100% of our design tokens across all supported platforms (which by our definition now includes Figma). In total this took 1.5 months.</p>
<p>Next time we’ll dive into some components!</p>
