        <!-- Content -->
        <p class="spacing-medium-top">August 2024 — Thank you for your consideration. My <a href="index.html">selected
                works</a> tell all the details of my recent work, but
            that’s a lot to get through. Here’s a quick overview tailored specifically to the Staff Design Technologist
            role.</p>

        <ul class="small-text sec-text spacing-medium-bottom spacing-medium-top">
            <li>Develop working prototypes to explore new features, content strategies, and interaction models, ensuring
                the right questions are addressed and distinct user needs are met.</li>
            <li>Facilitate decision-making and discussions by creating tangible artifacts that bring UX solutions to
                life, focusing on interaction and motion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I love prototypes. I use Xcode daily and am currently learning Android Studio (thank you, David Morant).
            Despite the learning curve, I prefer to use the same tools as my engineering colleagues to easily work
            together and get as “real” as possible. I believe this will be especially helpful to SubX because I’ve
            learned that Newsreader’s legacy codebases sometimes lead to tricky challenges, which I’d uncover quickly.
        </p>

        <p>For example, in <a href="swift-tales-3.html">Swift Tales 3</a>, I show how I built a fully custom context
            menu prototype in SwiftUI to
            demonstrate GeometryReader techniques. While it was a cool prototype, it led me to ask the right question:
            Can we even build this on time? The answer was a resounding <span class="bold-text">no</span>. I used this code to gain agreement between
            iOS engineers, Jason Fujikuni, and Tiffany Pai to stick with Apple’s native Menu for now.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, I recently helped Sandy Zhang build a low-fidelity prototype in about 2 hours to demonstrate
            her seemingly complex pattern of using navigation inside of a bottom sheet. We learned that programming the
            interaction and motion was surprisingly easy. She’s continuing her designs in Xcode.</p>

        <ul class="small-text sec-text spacing-medium-bottom spacing-medium-top">
            <li>Partner with designers and researchers to uncover user challenges and use these insights to inform your
                UX decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I regularly use my
            code and design experience to uncover accessibility and usability challenges through prototyping. For example, I recently prototyped and 4 new user
            onboarding screens for Mitch Atkin to demonstrate VoiceOver techniques which required adding builds to my own phone.</p>

        <p>Although I don’t get to work with researchers at the Times often, I have extensive research experience. At
            Robinhood, I conducted in-person field research for 2 weeks in Brazil to gain insights to inform a brand-new
            crypto app design. At Airbnb, I conducted usability testing with Support Specialists several times to inform
            my design decisions at several fidelities. </p>

        <ul class="small-text sec-text spacing-medium-bottom spacing-medium-top">
            <li>Ensure a seamless connection between design and engineering by maintaining design/UX visions through
                code, applying technical architecture and data to create realistic user and journalistic scenarios in
                prototypes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my 10 years of coding and design experience, I’ve found that acknowledging constraints early yields
            exceptionally well-crafted products. I’d love to apply this thinking in SubX.</p>

        <p><a href="swift-tales-1.html">Swift Tales 1</a> tells how I translated typographic line height into iOS, a
            detail I care much about as a
            designer. I only uncovered the niche quirks, and even a 10-year-old bug, by deeply understanding code and
            design together.</p>

        <p>On the TPL team, I ensure our components work across diverse technical architectures. For example, Dialog
            handles presentation in UIKit so that the fade-in animation works correctly in the Newsreader and Audio
            apps.</p>

        <ul class="small-text sec-text spacing-medium-bottom spacing-medium-top">
            <li>Contribute to the continuous improvement of design standards, guidelines, and reusable components.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>As an experienced designer of products <em>and</em> design systems, I know the joy of using systems that speed up work
            without sacrificing design quality. I’d love to help find that balance for SubX.</p>

        <p>On the TPL team, I maintain a finite set of typography and color tokens across several platforms (read more
            about that in <a href="swift-tales-1.html">Swift Tales 1</a>). However, I also work with teams to add the
            right amount of flexibility. For
            example, Dialog uses Text views that come with default styles but can easily be overridden with different
            typography tokes (see <a href="swift-tales-3.html">Swift Tales 3</a>).</p>


        <ul class="small-text sec-text spacing-medium-bottom spacing-medium-top">
            <li>Participate in design rituals and the hiring process for design roles within the product design team.
            </li>
            <li>Promote a culture of innovation by inspiring and mentoring teammates, enhancing processes, and improving
                documentation through prototyping activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The greatest gift of working at the Times is the friendships. I love learning from designers like Nate, Jak,
            Jay, and Jaime as well as engineers like Paul Bonneville, David Morant, and Joe Bramhall. I’m also honored
            to be known as an accessibility subject matter expert—a responsibility I treat with care, meeting folks
            where they’re at to build trusting relationships.</p>

        <p>For example, I’ve led 2 “SwiftUI for Designers” workshops where I taught 10 designers to set up
            Xcode/GitHub and SwiftUI basics. I reviewed portfolios for the past two summer
            internship programs and am honored to play an active role in our summer interns’ learning and growth. And I’ve lead the Inclusive Design squad for a year.</p>
