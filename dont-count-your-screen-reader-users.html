        Don't count your screen reader users
      </h1>

      <p class="sec-text">
        August 2022 — The gist: If your app isn't enjoyable for screen reader
        users, they are probably not using it and can't be counted anyway. The
        number of screen reader users who use your app shouldn’t determine
        whether you design for them.
      </p>

          The other day I was chatting with a colleague about some of the
          intricacies of designing good screen reader experiences. They
          suggested, "Shouldn't we measure how many of our customers actually
          use screen readers before we start dedicating resources toward this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I get how this can make sense at first—why go through the extra effort
          of designing for a set of users if they'll only account for a tiny
          amount of total users? Couldn't we do something more important with
          our resources?
        </p>
        <p>
          My first thought to this type of inquiry is if just
          <em>one</em> person—our CEO—used a screen reader, designing for screen
          reader users wouldn't even be a question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not designing with screen reader users in mind is obviously
          frustrating your current users who use screen readers. But remember:
          If your app isn't accessible, folks who use assistive technologies
          have probably moved on. If so... who's left to count?
        </p>
        <p>
          When we count how many current users rely on screen readers, or any
          other assistive technologies, we aren't actually measuring all of the
          people who would benefit from inclusive design. Counting screen reader
          users hardly makes sense in any discussion about the importance of
          accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, should any person ever be treated merely as an edge case?
