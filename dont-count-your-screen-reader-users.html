    <!-- Don't count your screen reader users. -->
    <h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">Don't count your screen reader users.</h1>

    <p class="sec-text spacing-medium-top">August 2022 — The gist: If your app isn't enjoyable for screen reader users,
      they are
      probably not using it and can't be counted anyway. The number of screen reader users who use your app
      shouldn’t determine whether you design for them.</p>

    <div class="spacing-medium-top">
      <p>The other day I was chatting with a colleague about some of the intricacies of designing good screen reader
        experiences. They suggested, "Shouldn't we measure how many of our customers actually use screen readers before
        we start dedicating resources toward this?"</p>
      <p>I get how this can make sense at first—why go through the extra effort of designing for a set of users if
        they'll only account for a tiny amount of total users? Couldn't we do something more important with our
        resources?</p>
      <p>My first thought to this type of inquiry is if just <em>one</em> person—our CEO—used a screen reader, designing for
        screen reader users wouldn't even be a question.</p>
      <p>Not designing with screen reader users in mind is obviously frustrating your current users who use screen
        readers. But remember: If your app isn't accessible, folks who use assistive technologies have probably moved
        on.
        If so... who's left to count?</p>
      <p>When we count how many current users rely on screen readers, or any other assistive technologies, we
        aren't actually measuring all of the people who would benefit from inclusive design. Counting screen reader
        users hardly makes sense in any discussion about the importance of accessibility.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, should any person ever be treated merely as an edge case?</p>
