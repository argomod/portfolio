    <!-- Don't count your screen reader users. -->
    <h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">Don't count your screen reader users.</h1>

    <p class="sec-text spacing-medium-top">August 2022 — The gist: The number of screen reader users who use your app
      shouldn’t determine whether you design for them. If your app isn't enjoyable for screen reader users, they are
      probably not around to be counted anyway.</p>

    <div class="spacing-medium-top">
      <p>The other day I was chatting with a colleague about some of the intricacies of designing good screen reader
        experiences. They suggested, "Shouldn't we measure how many of our customers actually use screen readers before
        we start dedicating resources toward this?"</p>
      <p>I get how this can make sense at first—why go through the extra effort of designing for a set of users if
        they'll only account for a tiny amount of total users? Couldn't we do something more important with our
        resources?</p>
      <p>To be honest – I'm sorry! – my first thought to this type of thing is, "If our CEO used a screen reader, we
        wouldn't even be asking the question." Numbers are less objective once you become that number and when they
        cause you, or someone you care about, to be excluded.</p>
      <p>Not designing with screen reader users in mind is obviously frustrating your current users who use screen
        readers. But it's also worth asking: Why would they want to use an app or website that doesn't care about their
        needs? And if they're avoiding your app... who's left to count?</p>
      <p>You can't measure exclusion.</p>
      <p>When you count how many of your current users rely on screen readers, or any other assistive technologies, you
        aren't actually measuring all of the people who would benefit from inclusive design.</p>
      <p>Counting screen reader users hardly makes sense in any discussion about the importance of accessibility.
        Furthermore, should any human ever be treated as an edge case?</p>
