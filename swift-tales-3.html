      <!-- Swift Tales 3 -->
      <h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">Swift Tales 3</h1>
      <p class="sec-text">
        July 2024 — After finishing Menu, the TPL team built a full-screen modal
        with a scrim and animation used to announce new products or features,
        called Dialog.
      </p>

      <p class="sec-text">
        Jaclyn Saik led design. Joseph Kohlmann led engineering. I led a mix of
        design and engineering. Sergio Cuevas contributed engineering. We
        completed this work in 3 months.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bold-text spacing-large-top">Called in</h2>

      <p>
        Jac asked for my help translating her design vision for Dialog into iOS
        code. The visuals were mostly done in Figma, Brand was happy with them,
        and so were the teams who’d likely use Dialog in their work. When I hop
        into work in progress, my goal is to keep the original driver in the
        driver's seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        My responsibility was to be as helpful as possible to Joe and Sergio in
        building the design. I was able to code typography, color, and spacing
        independently, polishing Jac's design work. But additionally, I found I
        was able to contribute in new ways to the coding experience itself.
      </p>

      <!-- Hello, UIKit -->
      <h2 class="bold-text spacing-large-top">Hello, UIKit</h2>
      <p>
        We found a nice fit with .fullScreenCover, but unfortunately, we
        couldn’t replace the slide-up animation with a fade-in. Cam Pulsford,
        principal iOS engineer and guardian angel, recommended we dabble in
        UIKit.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Joe would commit a UIKit experiment in GitHub, I’d pull it and see
        if I could understand it enough to implement it by myself. If I, a
        junior Swiftie, could figure it out, we’d be in a safe zone for the rest
        of our engineering customers.

      <!-- Hello, DocC -->
      <h2 class="bold-text spacing-large-top">Hello, DocC</h2>

      <p>
        By this point in my coding journey, I felt Apple’s own SwiftUI and UIKit
        docs were sometimes… lacking. Now I had my chance to step to the plate
        because Dialog’s SwiftUI and UIKit mixture needed thorough explanation.
        As I mentioned in <a href="./swift-tales-1.html">Swift Tales 1</a>, this
        was an awesome opportunity to contribute to the polish phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joe trusted me to figure out Apple’s documentation language,
        <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/" target="_blank"
          >DocC</a
        >. There are four types of DocC documentation I used:
      </p>

      <ul class="spacing-small-bottom">
        <li>
          Source code: In-line code comments marked with three forward slashes
          (///)
        </li>
        <li>
          Tutorials: Step-by-step text and code samples to walk through how to
          make a Dialog
        </li>
        <li>
          Sample code article: A freeform page of text that hosts small bits of
          code
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Through trial and error, I learned that setting up a Dialog was best
        explained in a tutorial and styling was best explained in a sample code
        article. Source code comments are extra-special: they offer help for
        those who prefer to dive into the source code, and they also appear in
        Xcode's Quick Help.
      </p>

      <!-- Patterns -->
      <h2 class="bold-text spacing-large-top">Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Joe and I bounced around quite a few ideas for the structure of Dialog’s
        code. At this point, I learned through my own experiences of using TPL
        that ergonomics can make it especially enjoyable. But what did our
        customers prefer in <em>their</em> day-to-day?
      </p>

      <p>
        To answer that question, I led two usability sessions where we asked iOS
        engineers to import the iOS-TPL library and try using Dialog in their
        own codebase. We learned a few important things:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Many Times engineers are new to SwiftUI, just like us.</li>
        <li>
          Tutorial documentation was a hit. While great for beginners in
          SwiftUI, it also worked very well to show how to integrate with UIKit,
          which is moderately difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          Visual previews in our source code were also very helpful for those
          who prefer to jump right in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Less code tends to feel more ergonomic. For example, trailing closure
          syntax eliminates the need to declare a parameter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexibility to pass in views, rather than strings, is expected (this
          is different from Figma properties, for example).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Summary -->
      <h2 class="bold-text spacing-large-top">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        We shipped Dialog on time. I led usability testing, and I built the code
        tutorials and sample code articles. I collaborated with Joe to architect
        the structure of the component. And I collaborated with Jac to translate
        design decisions to code.
      </p>

      <p class="spacing-medium-top">
        I learned to connect SwiftUI and UIKit which became very important as I
        studied more about the varied code bases across the NYT apps. But more
        about that in a future installment.
