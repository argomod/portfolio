    <!-- Swift Tales 3 -->
    <h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">Swift Tales 3</h1>
    <p class="sec-text spacing-medium-top">July 2024 — After finishing Menu, the TPL team built a
      full-screen modal with a scrim and animation called Dialog.</p>


    <!-- Team and timeline -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Team and timeline</h2>
    <p>Jaclyn Saik led design. Joseph Kohlmann led engineering. Sergio Cuevas contributed engineering. I led a mix of
      design and engineering. We completed this work in 3 months.</p>

    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Called in</h2>

    <p>Dialog is a modal that covers an entire screen, animating in a box of content and actions with a semi-transparent
      scrim. It’s used to announce new products or features.</p>

    <p>At the Times, I’ve learned that designers appreciate independence. We even have an internal motto, “Strong
      opinions held loosely”. So when we split design work on the team I make it clear that I’ll jump in only when
      called in.</p>

    <p>Jac called me in before taking a well-earned vacation, and at a great moment. The visuals were mostly done in
      Figma, Brand was happy with them, and so were the teams who’d likely use Dialog in their work.</p>

    <p>My responsibility was to be as helpful as possible to Joe and Sergio in building the design by our
      deadline. They had just started exploring SwfitUI paradigms, so with their enthusiastic permission, I joined them.
    </p>


    <!-- Hello, UIKit -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Hello, UIKit</h2>
    <p>We found a nice fit with .fullScreenCover, but unfortunately, we couldn’t replace the slide-up animation with a
      fade-in. Cam Pulsford, principal iOS engineer and guardian angel, recommended we dabble in UIKit.</p>

    <p>When Joe would commit a UIKit experiment in GitHub, I’d pull it and see if I could understand it enough to
      implement it by myself. If I, a junior Swiftie, could figure it out, we’d be in a safe zone for the rest of our
      engineering customers.</p>

    <!-- Hello, DocC -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Hello, DocC</h2>

    <p>By this point in my coding journey, I felt Apple’s own SwiftUI and UIKit docs were sometimes… lacking. Now I had
      my chance to step to the plate because Dialog’s SwiftUI and UIKit mixture needed thorough explanation. As I
      mentioned in <a href="./swift-tales-1.html">Swift Tales 1</a>, this was an awesome opportunity to contribute to
      the <span class="bold-text">polish</span> phase.</p>

    <p>Joe trusted me to figure out Apple’s documentation language, <a
        href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/" target="_blank">DocC</a>. There are four types of DocC documentation I
      used:</p>

    <ul class="spacing-small-bottom">
      <li>Source code: In-line code comments marked with three forward slashes (///).</li>
      <li>Tutorials: Step-by-step text and code samples to walk through how to make a Dialog.</li>
      <li>Sample code article: A freeform page of text that hosts small bits of code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through trial and error, I learned that setting up a Dialog was best explained in a tutorial, and styling was
      best explained in a sample code article. Source code comments are extra-special: they offer help for those who
      prefer to dive into the source code and they also appear in Quick Help.</p>

    <!-- Patterns -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Patterns</h2>
    <p>Joe and I bounced around quite a few ideas for the structure of Dialog’s code. At this point,
      I learned through my own experiences of using TPL that ergonomics can make it especially enjoyable. But what did
      our
      customers prefer in <em>their</em> day-to-day?</p>

    <p>To answer that question, I led two usability sessions where we asked iOS engineers to import the iOS-TPL library
      and try using Dialog. We learned a few important things:</p>

    <ul class="spacing-small-bottom">
      <li>Many engineers are new to SwiftUI, just like us.</li>
      <li>Tutorial documentation was a hit. While great for beginners in SwiftUI, it also worked very well to show how
        to integrate with UIKit, which is moderately difficult.</li>
      <li>Visual previews in our source code were also very helpful for those who prefer to jump right in.</li>
      <li>Less code tends to feel more ergonomic. For example, trailing closure syntax eliminates the need to declare a
        parameter.</li>
      <li>Flexibility to pass in views of your own is expected (unlike Figma, for example).</li>
    </ul>

    prarameters accept Text views rather than strings." />

    <!-- Summary -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Summary</h2>
    <p>We shipped Dialog on time. I led usability testing and I built the code tutorials and sample code articles. I
      collaborated with Joe to architect the structure of the component. And I collaborated with Jac to translate design
      decisions to code.</p>

    <p class="spacing-small-top">I learned about connecting SwiftUI and UIKit, which would end up being very useful as I
      learned more about the
      varied code bases across the NYT apps. More about that in a later installment.</p>
