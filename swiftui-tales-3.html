<h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">Swift Tales 3</h1>       
<p class="sec-text spacing-medium-top">July 2024 — After finishing Menu, the TPL team focused on Dialog. (That was the component’s code name and it stuck).</p>


<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Team and timeline</h2>
<p>Jaclyn Saik led design. Joseph Kohlmann led engineering. Sergio Cuevas contributed engineering. I led what I’ll call “design engineering”. We completed this work in 3 months.</p>

<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Called in</h2>

<p>Dialog is a modal that covers an entire screen, producing a box of content and actions with a semi-transparent scrim. It’s used to announce new products or features.</p>

<p>At the Times, I’ve learned that designers appreciate independence. We even have an internal motto, “Strong opinions held loosely”. So when we split design work on the team I make it clear that I’ll jump in only when called in.</p>

<p>Jac called me in before taking a well-earned vacation, and at a great moment. The visuals were mostly done in Figma, Brand was happy with them, and so were the teams who’d likely use Dialog in their work.</p>

<p>My responsibility was to be as helpful to Joe and Sergio as possible in bringing the design to code by our deadline. They had just started exploring SwfitUI paradigms, so with their enthusiastic permission, I joined them.</p>

<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Hello, UIKit</h2>
<p>We found a nice fit with .fullScreenCover, but unfortunately, we couldn’t replace the slide-up animation with a fade-in. Cam Pulsford, principal iOS engineer and guardian angel, recommended we dabble in UIKit.</p>

<p>When Joe would commit a UIKit experiment in GitHub, I’d pull it and see if I could understand it enough to implement it by myself. If I, a junior Swiftie, could figure it out, we’d be in a safe zone for the rest of our engineering customers.</p>

<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>

<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Hello, DocC</h2>

<p>By this point in my coding journey, I felt Apple’s own SwiftUI and UIKit docs were sometimes… lacking. Now I had my chance to step to the plate because Dialog’s SwiftUI and UIKit mixture needed thorough explanation. As I mentioned in Swift Tales 1, this was an awesome opportunity to contribute to the <span class="bold-text">phase.</span> </p>

<p>Joe trusted me to figure out Apple’s documentation language, DocC. There are four types of DocC documentation I used:</p>

<ul class="spacing-small-bottom">
  <li>Source code: In-line code comments marked with three forward slashes (///).</li>
  <li>Tutorials: Step-by-step text and code samples to walk through how to make a Dialog.</li>
  <li>Sample code article: A freeform page of text that hosts small bits of code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through trial and error, I learned that setting up a Dialog was best explained in a tutorial, and styling was best explained in a sample code article. Source code comments are extra-special: they offer help for those who prefer to dive into the source code and they also appear in Quick Help.</p>

<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>


<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Patterns</h2>
<p>Joe and I bounced around quite a few ideas for the structure of Dialog’s code between each other. At this point, I learned through my own experience using TPL that ergonomics can make it especially enjoyable. But what did our customers prefer in their day-to-day?</p>

<p>To answer that question, I led two usability sessions where we asked iOS engineers to import the iOS-TPL library and try using Dialog.  We learned a few important things:</p>

<ul class="spacing-small-bottom">
  <li>Many engineers are new to SwiftUI, just like us.</li>
  <li>Tutorial documentation was a hit. While great for beginners in SwiftUI, it also worked very well to show how to integrate with UIKit, which is moderately difficult.</li>
  <li>Visual previews in our source code were also very helpful for those who prefer to jump right in.</li>
  <li>Less code tends to feel more ergonomic. For example, omitting the content parameter by using trailing closure syntax was easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sec-text center-text">[image]</p>

<h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Summary</h2>
<p>We shipped Dialog on time. I led usability testing and I built the code tutorials and sample code articles. I collaborated with Joe to architect the structure of the component. And I collaborated with Jac to translate design decisions to code.</p>
<p>I learned about connecting SwiftUI and UIKit, which would end up being very useful as I learned more about the varied code bases across the NYT apps. More about that in a later installment.</p>
