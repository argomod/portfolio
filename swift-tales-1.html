    <h1 class="large-text bold-text spacing-medium-top">Swift Tales 1</h1>

    <p class="sec-text spacing-medium-top">July 2024 — This is the first installment of how I contributed to building
      the Times Product Language (TPL) design system for iOS.</p>

    <p class="sec-text">The TPL team is me, Joseph Kohlmann, Sergio Cuevas, Riley Sykes, Jaclyn Saik, Norel Hassan, and
      Dan Mall. We began by learning the basics of SwiftUI and then transforming our tokens for color, typography, and
      spacing.</p>


    <!-- Humble beginnings -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Humble beginnings</h2>

    <p>"Should designers code?”</p>

    <p>That pesky question hit me differently when the TPL team was asked to spend 2024 making iOS components. We
      weren’t iOS engineers nor had we formally made anything in SwiftUI or UIKit, Apple’s most modern coding languages.</p>

    <p>To answer: On the one hand, no; designers work in nebulous circumstances where the right
      skills can vary. But in that moment, oddly enough, I remember feeling absurdly fortunate. How rare it is to see the
      right opportunity, even an uncertain one, so clearly. Yes—<em>this</em> designer was going to learn to make stuff in
      iOS.</p>

    <p>So I learned the same way our engineers Joe and Sergio did. We spent many hours Googling, practicing, and
      rigorously iterating our work. I studied at nights and had fun making sample projects with <a
        href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui" target="_blank">Hacking With Swift</a>. And <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/" target="_blank">Swift Playgrounds</a> also hooked me.</p>

    <p>Despite the same effort, I developed strengths that were different from those of Joe and Sergio. As deeply
      experienced engineers, they were excellent at making source code efficient for production by applying their wisdom
      from other languages.</p>

    <p>But as a designer, I connect different dots really well:</p>

    <ol class="spacing-small-bottom">
      <li>At the <span class="bold-text">prototyping</span> phase, where I need to balance design
        requirements and engineering feasibility (<a href="https://github.com/argomod/ios-prototypes-2024" target="_blank">see my latest iOS prototypes in GitHub</a>.)</li>
      <li>At the <span class="bold-text">polish</span> phase, where I need to make documentation and code
        comments feel like a cohesive product (<a href="./swift-tales-3.html">see Swift Tales 3</a> for an example).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>On top of that, I learned to test VoiceOver and Dynamic Type and can now write code enhancements for
      accessibility.</p>

    <!-- Line height -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Line height</h2>

    <p>The journey to translate line height (the space between lines of text) to iOS highlights how I connect dots at
      the <span class="bold-text">prototyping</span> phase.</p>

    <p>I feel line height is a special detail that makes visuals shine (designer alert!), so I was motivated to make it
      accurate across all of our supported platforms.</p>

    <p>Our design system uses JSON to store a single source of truth for basic design decisions. Ideally, one value can
      be directly injected into our code or conveniently translated to work with a platform’s preferred convention. My
      responsibility was to decide what integer makes the most sense to represent line height in TPL’s JSON repository.
    </p>

    <p>On web, line height can be expressed in any unit accepted in CSS; <a
        href="https://allthingssmitty.com/2017/01/30/nope-nope-nope-line-height-is-unitless/" target="_blank">unitless numbers are most
        accessible</a>. In Figma, line height is expressed either in pixels or as a percentage.</p>

    <img class="selected-work-image spacing-xsmall-bottom spacing-small-top" src="./assets/swift-tales-1-4.png" alt="A few examples of how to set line height in Figma
    and web." />
    <p aria-hidden="true" class="sec-text small-text">A few examples of how to set line height in Figma
      and web.</p>

    <p class="spacing-small-top">I used Xcode to study how line height is set in <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/linespacing(_:)">SwiftUI</a> and <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nsmutableparagraphstyle/1528742-linespacing">UIKit</a>,
      called lineSpacing. I learned lineSpacing also takes an integer… but using the number that Figma produced was way
      off. What’s happening here?</p>

    <img class="selected-work-image spacing-xsmall-bottom spacing-small-top" src="./assets/swift-tales-1-5.png" alt="A line height prototype with Figma depicted
    on the left and
    Xcode on the right. lineSpacing
    in SwiftUI is much taller." />
    <p aria-hidden="true" class="sec-text small-text spacing-small-bottom">A line height prototype with Figma depicted
      on the left and
      Xcode on the right. lineSpacing
      in SwiftUI is much taller.</p>

    <p class="spacing-small-top">iOS’s lineSpacing works similarly to pixels in Figma and web, but the integer starts with the font size. For
      example, a lineSpacing value of 0 applied to a font size of 16pt yields a 16pt line height, and a lineSpacing
      value of 2 applied to a font size of 18pt yields a 20pt line height.</p>

    <p>With this knowledge, Joe and I decided to
      store a percentage in JSON and then translate it to an integer in iOS with the following formula I created:</p>

    <div class="call-out-container spacing spacing-small-top spacing-small-bottom">
      <p class="center-text">lineSpacing = font size - (font size * percentage)</p>
    </div>

    <p class="spacing-xsmall-top">Interestingly I discovered it’s impossible to provide a lineSpacing value less than 0,
      or 100% of the font size. This isn’t common in practice, but alas, one of The New York Times's condensed fonts
      used less than 100% on web. When I brought this up to my new iOS engineering friends I was aghast to
      learn that for 10 years (!) this particular font was culturally known to be a pain and “impossible to fix”. </p>

    <p>But how fortunate again I felt again. My journey had led me to find a problem that annoyed engineers for years,
      and one I uniquely had the skill and patience to fix. Over 2 days I used FontForge to adjust the metrics manually,
      tested it
      in Xcode, and together we shipped the fixed font file to production.</p>

    <img class="selected-work-image spacing-xsmall-bottom spacing-small-top" src="./assets/swift-tales-1-6.png" alt="A diagram breaking down font metrics by using
    screenshots from
    Xcode and

      screenshots from
      Xcode and
      Font Forge.</p>

    <p class="spacing-small-top">I found another strange problem in how iOS distributes line height around text.</p>

    <p>While web and Figma equally split line height above and below a line of text, Apple places space only in-between
      lines of text. Yes, this is why our designs have spacing issues around text after handoff! Joe and I call this
      the “half-leading problem”.</p>

      the difference
      between the two, which equals half of lineSpacing in SwiftUI.</p>

    <p class="spacing-small-top">By now, you know how much I care about line height. But I also now have new hard-earned wisdom. While I may
      have asked my engineers to “fix this” in the past, this was a simple problem with no simple solution. We
      decided not to attempt a programmatic fix to stay within scope and meet our deadline.</p>


    <!-- Summary -->
    <h2 class="bold-text spacing-medium-top">Summary</h2>
    <p>In 1.5 months I, Joe, and Sergio learned the basics of coding in iOS and distributed 100% of our JSON library of
      color, typography, and spacing tokens for use in SwiftUI. I used my new Xcode prototyping skills to solve problems
      quickly and to balance design requirements with engineering feasibility.</p>
    <p>In the <a href="./swift-tales-2.html">next installment</a>, we’ll dive into our first iOS components!</p>
